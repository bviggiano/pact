**pandas 🐼** is a powerful library in Python used for data analysis. In this mini-assignment, we will explore the concept of `vectorization`, a powerful construct that enables drastic performance benefits.


### Set Up 🛠
To begin, we will need to set up an virtual environment with the necessary packages. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python interpreter (aka Python installation) and any additional packages/modules that are required for a specific project. It allows you to isolate your project's dependencies from other projects that may have different versions or requirements of the same packages.

Create a new virtual environment for this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
### Assignment 📝
To complete this assignment, follow the instructions in `pandas_practice.ipynb`. This notebook contains a series of exercises that will help you practice using vectorized operations in pandas.

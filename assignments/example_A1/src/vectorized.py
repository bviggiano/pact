def check_speed_vectorized(poke_df: pd.DataFrame, speed_min: int = 100) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Creates a new column in the DataFrame called "is_fast" containing a boolean value
    for each Pokemon. The value should be True if the Pokemon's speed is above the
    variable `speed_min` and False otherwise.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Use vectorized operations to create the new column.
        - Do not use any for loops.

    Args:
        poke_df (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing the Pokemon data.
        speed_min (int): The minimum speed threshold for a Pokemon to be considered fast.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The pandas DataFrame containing the Pokemon data with an additional
                      column called "is_fast" that contains a boolean value for each Pokemon

    Filters the DataFrame to only include Pokemon that are of the specified type.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Use vectorized operations to filter the DataFrame.

        - IMPORTANT: Do not modify the original DataFrame.

    Args:
        poke_df (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame containing the Pokemon data.

    Creates a column in the DataFrame called "is_mega" containing a boolean value

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:

# `assignments/`

Each directory in this repository will be considered an assignment directory by PACT. We have included a few example assignments in the assignments directory as demonstrations.

To create a new assignment, simply create a new directory within the `assignments/` directory and place the solution code for the assignment within that directory.


To read more about how to use PACT to create assignments, check out the [PACT README](../pact/README.md) file.

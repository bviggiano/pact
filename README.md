## Key Features ‚ú®
- **Configurable Masking**: Easily convert programming assignment solutions into student-friendly "skelton" files by masking solution code and replacing with placeholders.

- **Testing and Grading integration**: 
Write unit tests for assignments that can be utilized with Gradescope or your own custom testing framework to automatically grade student submissions.

- **Version Control**: Automatically manage version control for course assignments, allowing for easy tracking of changes and updates to various assignment files.

## How it works! üõ†Ô∏è
PACT works by converting fully solved programming assignments into versions that are ready to distribute to students. This customizable behavior is achieved through the use of keywords and comments in the solution version of the assignments that PACT can recognize and act upon.


## Getting Started üöÄ
This PACT repository is designed to be utilized as a starting template for a repository containing the assignments for your course. Since this repository will contain the solution versions of the assignments, it is recommended to keep it private to prevent students from accessing the solution code.

The easiest way to get started with PACT is to use this repository as a template.
1. Navigate to [github.com/bviggiano/pact](https://github.com/bviggiano/pact)]
2. Click on the "Use this template" button, located above the file list and next to the "Code" button.
3. Select "Create a new repository"
4. On the repository creation page, choose a repository name (e.g., `CS101`) and set the visibility to `private`.


Finally, after you have your private repository set up, set up the pact conda environment by running the following commands from the root of the repository:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pact_env
pip install -e .
```

You can begin developing your assignments to the repository! Check out the [./pact/README.md](./pact/README.md) file for more information on how to use PACT to create assignments.
